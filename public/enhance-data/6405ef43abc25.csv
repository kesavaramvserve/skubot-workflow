Simply pinch the grip  between fingers and push to fit, which keeps the tip going into the ears clean even if hands are somewhat soiled with dirt, oil, grease, or some other contaminant. The unique, slow recovery foam is easy to fit in the earcanal with no roll-down required for a comfortable, noise-blocking seal. Assorted grip colors available.    * These soft polyurethane foam earplugs have a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of 25 dB and are test compatible with the 3M E-A-Rfit Validation System.  Not only is noise present in our daily routines and recreational activities, but millions of Americans work in hazardous noise on a daily basis. Estimates from the National Institutes of Health suggest that approximately 15 percent of Americans (26 million people) between the ages of 20 and 69 have high frequency hearing loss due to exposure to noise at work or during leisure activities. Hearing loss due to noise is almost entirely preventable by judicious use of hearing protection. *  * *The NRR may overestimate the hearing protection provided during typical use. 3M recommends reducing the NRR by 50% for estimating the amount of noise reduction provided. *

                    The 3M E-A-R UltraFit Corded Earplugs feature a no-roll, triple-flange design that provides quick, clean, and comfortable hearing protection. Simply hold the stem and push the earplug into the ear. The tip stays clean even if hands are dirty or gloves are worn. The soft polymer earplugs are washable and reusable so they dont need to be replaced as often, reducing waste and lowerings costs. Poly bag keeps earplugs clean prior to use. Recommended applications include assembly and mechanical, chipping, chiseling, cleaning, drilling, furnace operations, grinding, heavy equipment operations, machining, metal repair, painting, pouring/casting, power fastening, riveting, sanding, sawing and welding. These earplugs are commonly used in the following industries: construction, general manufacturing, mining, oil and gas, and transportation.  These soft polymer earplugs have a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of 25 dB and are test compatible with the 3M E-A-Rfit Validation System.  Not only is noise present in our daily routines and recreational activities, but millions of Americans work in hazardous noise on a daily basis. Estimates from the National Institutes of Health suggest that approximately 15 percent of Americans (26 million people) between the ages of 20 and 69 have high frequency hearing loss due to exposure to noise at work or during leisure activities. Hearing loss due to noise is almost entirely preventable by judicious use of hearing protection. *  * *The NRR may overestimate the hearing protection provided during typical use. 3M recommends reducing the NRR by 50% for estimating the amount of noise reduction provided. *

                
                </div>","The 3M E-A-R UltraFit Corded Earplugs feature a no-roll, triple-flange design that provides quick, clean, and comfortable hearing protection. Simply hold the stem and push the earplug into the ear. The tip stays clean even if hands are dirty or gloves are worn.

These soft polymer earplugs have a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of 25 dB and are test compatible with the 3M E-A-Rfit Validation System. Not only is noise present in our daily routines and recreational activities, but millions of Americans work in hazardous noise on a daily basis.

                    The 3M™ Paper Sheet 426U is a premium silicon carbide sheet that helps create a smoother finish than aluminum oxide or garnet abrasive products on painted metal and wood substrates. Its resin bond construction provides superior grain retention while the open coat construction, along with the load-resistant coating, combine to provide excellent anti-loading characteristics. The light A-weight backing helps provide conformability over contours and into hard-to-reach areas. The sheet can also be easily cut to fit a hand pad block, inline sanders or finishing or power sanders. Other applications include general sanding, finishing, blending, surface leveling and prep prior to staining or painting. These versatile sanding sheets contain the ideal abrasive grain type and grades for multi-step finishing processes.

Simply pinch the grip  between fingers and push to fit, which keeps the tip going into the ears clean even if hands are somewhat soiled with dirt, oil, grease, or some other contaminant. The unique, slow recovery foam is easy to fit in the earcanal with no roll-down required for a comfortable, noise-blocking seal. Assorted grip colors available.    * These soft polyurethane foam earplugs have a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of 25 dB and are test compatible with the 3M E-A-Rfit Validation System.  Not only is noise present in our daily routines and recreational activities, but millions of Americans work in hazardous noise on a daily basis. Estimates from the National Institutes of Health suggest that approximately 15 percent of Americans (26 million people) between the ages of 20 and 69 have high frequency hearing loss due to exposure to noise at work or during leisure activities. Hearing loss due to noise is almost entirely preventable by judicious use of hearing protection. *  * *The NRR may overestimate the hearing protection provided during typical use. 3M recommends reducing the NRR by 50% for estimating the amount of noise reduction provided. *

Simply hold the stem and push the earplug into the ear. The tip stays clean even if hands are dirty or gloves are worn. The soft polymer earplugs are washable and reusable so they dont need to be replaced as often, reducing waste and lowerings costs. Poly bag keeps earplugs clean prior to use. Recommended applications include assembly and mechanical, chipping, chiseling, cleaning, drilling, furnace operations, grinding, heavy equipment operations, machining, metal repair, painting, pouring/casting, power fastening, riveting, sanding, sawing and welding. These earplugs are commonly used in the following industries: construction, general manufacturing, mining, oil and gas, and transportation.  These soft polymer earplugs have a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of 25 dB and are test compatible with the 3M E-A-Rfit Validation System.  Not only is noise present in our daily routines and recreational activities, but millions of Americans work in hazardous noise on a daily basis. Estimates from the National Institutes of Health suggest that approximately 15 percent of Americans (26 million people) between the ages of 20 and 69 have high frequency hearing loss due to exposure to noise at work or during leisure activities. Hearing loss due to noise is almost entirely preventable by judicious use of hearing protection. *  * *The NRR may overestimate the hearing protection provided during typical use. 3M recommends reducing the NRR by 50% for estimating the amount of noise reduction provided. *

                    3M All Weather Flashing Tape 8067 is engineered to increase productivity while solving the most critical flashing problems. Unique acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive sticks and stays stuck to seal around windows, doors and other openings. To prevent moisture intrusion, the thin backing construction effectively conforms and seals around nails and staples with less buildup under siding. Proprietary construction will not liquefy, bleed, or melt in contact with many building sealants or in extreme summer temperatures. This backing is also tough, resists punctures and tears, yet it is thin to fit conveniently into corners and under siding. The split paper release liner provides fast application with easy and accurate positioning of the tape.

                    The 3M™ Paper Sheet 426U is a premium silicon carbide sheet that helps create a smoother finish than aluminum oxide or garnet abrasive products on painted metal and wood substrates. Its resin bond construction provides superior grain retention while the open coat construction, along with the load-resistant coating, combine to provide excellent anti-loading characteristics. The light A-weight backing helps provide conformability over contours and into hard-to-reach areas. The sheet can also be easily cut to fit a hand pad block, inline sanders or finishing or power sanders. Other applications include general sanding, finishing, blending, surface leveling and prep prior to staining or painting. These versatile sanding sheets contain the ideal abrasive grain type and grades for multi-step finishing processes.

                    The 3M E-A-R Express Pod Plugs Uncorded Earplugs feature a no-roll design with paddle style grips that provide quick, clean, and consistent fitting of hearing protection. Simply pinch the grip  between fingers and push to fit, which keeps the tip going into the ears clean even if hands are somewhat soiled with dirt, oil, grease, or some other contaminant. The unique, slow recovery foam is easy to fit in the earcanal with no roll-down required for a comfortable, noise-blocking seal. Assorted grip colors available.    * These soft polyurethane foam earplugs have a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of 25 dB and are test compatible with the 3M E-A-Rfit Validation System.  Not only is noise present in our daily routines and recreational activities, but millions of Americans work in hazardous noise on a daily basis. Estimates from the National Institutes of Health suggest that approximately 15 percent of Americans (26 million people) between the ages of 20 and 69 have high frequency hearing loss due to exposure to noise at work or during leisure activities. Hearing loss due to noise is almost entirely preventable by judicious use of hearing protection. *  * *The NRR may overestimate the hearing protection provided during typical use. 3M recommends reducing the NRR by 50% for estimating the amount of noise reduction provided. *

                    The 3M E-A-R UltraFit Corded Earplugs feature a no-roll, triple-flange design that provides quick, clean, and comfortable hearing protection. Simply hold the stem and push the earplug into the ear. The tip stays clean even if hands are dirty or gloves are worn. The soft polymer earplugs are washable and reusable so they dont need to be replaced as often, reducing waste and lowerings costs. Poly bag keeps earplugs clean prior to use. Recommended applications include assembly and mechanical, chipping, chiseling, cleaning, drilling, furnace operations, grinding, heavy equipment operations, machining, metal repair, painting, pouring/casting, power fastening, riveting, sanding, sawing and welding. These earplugs are commonly used in the following industries: construction, general manufacturing, mining, oil and gas, and transportation.  These soft polymer earplugs have a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of 25 dB and are test compatible with the 3M E-A-Rfit Validation System.  Not only is noise present in our daily routines and recreational activities, but millions of Americans work in hazardous noise on a daily basis. Estimates from the National Institutes of Health suggest that approximately 15 percent of Americans (26 million people) between the ages of 20 and 69 have high frequency hearing loss due to exposure to noise at work or during leisure activities. Hearing loss due to noise is almost entirely preventable by judicious use of hearing protection. *  * *The NRR may overestimate the hearing protection provided during typical use. 3M recommends reducing the NRR by 50% for estimating the amount of noise reduction provided. *

                    The 3M™ Paper Sheet 426U is a premium silicon carbide sheet that helps create a smoother finish than aluminum oxide or garnet abrasive products on painted metal and wood substrates. Its resin bond construction provides superior grain retention while the open coat construction, along with the load-resistant coating, combine to provide excellent anti-loading characteristics. The light A-weight backing helps provide conformability over contours and into hard-to-reach areas. The sheet can also be easily cut to fit a hand pad block, inline sanders or finishing or power sanders. Other applications include general sanding, finishing, blending, surface leveling and prep prior to staining or painting. These versatile sanding sheets contain the ideal abrasive grain type and grades for multi-step finishing processes.

                    The 3M E-A-R Express Pod Plugs Uncorded Earplugs feature a no-roll design with paddle style grips that provide quick, clean, and consistent fitting of hearing protection. Simply pinch the grip  between fingers and push to fit, which keeps the tip going into the ears clean even if hands are somewhat soiled with dirt, oil, grease, or some other contaminant. The unique, slow recovery foam is easy to fit in the earcanal with no roll-down required for a comfortable, noise-blocking seal. Assorted grip colors available.    * These soft polyurethane foam earplugs have a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of 25 dB and are test compatible with the 3M E-A-Rfit Validation System.  Not only is noise present in our daily routines and recreational activities, but millions of Americans work in hazardous noise on a daily basis. Estimates from the National Institutes of Health suggest that approximately 15 percent of Americans (26 million people) between the ages of 20 and 69 have high frequency hearing loss due to exposure to noise at work or during leisure activities. Hearing loss due to noise is almost entirely preventable by judicious use of hearing protection. *  * *The NRR may overestimate the hearing protection provided during typical use. 3M recommends reducing the NRR by 50% for estimating the amount of noise reduction provided. *

                    The 3M E-A-R UltraFit Corded Earplugs feature a no-roll, triple-flange design that provides quick, clean, and comfortable hearing protection. Simply hold the stem and push the earplug into the ear. The tip stays clean even if hands are dirty or gloves are worn. The soft polymer earplugs are washable and reusable so they dont need to be replaced as often, reducing waste and lowerings costs. Poly bag keeps earplugs clean prior to use. Recommended applications include assembly and mechanical, chipping, chiseling, cleaning, drilling, furnace operations, grinding, heavy equipment operations, machining, metal repair, painting, pouring/casting, power fastening, riveting, sanding, sawing and welding. These earplugs are commonly used in the following industries: construction, general manufacturing, mining, oil and gas, and transportation.  These soft polymer earplugs have a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of 25 dB and are test compatible with the 3M E-A-Rfit Validation System.  Not only is noise present in our daily routines and recreational activities, but millions of Americans work in hazardous noise on a daily basis. Estimates from the National Institutes of Health suggest that approximately 15 percent of Americans (26 million people) between the ages of 20 and 69 have high frequency hearing loss due to exposure to noise at work or during leisure activities. Hearing loss due to noise is almost entirely preventable by judicious use of hearing protection. *  * *The NRR may overestimate the hearing protection provided during typical use. 3M recommends reducing the NRR by 50% for estimating the amount of noise reduction provided. *

The light A-weight backing helps provide conformability over contours and into hard-to-reach areas. The sheet can also be easily cut to fit a hand pad block, inline sanders or finishing or power sanders. Other applications include general sanding, finishing, blending, surface leveling and prep prior to staining or painting. These versatile sanding sheets contain the ideal abrasive grain type and grades for multi-step finishing processes.

Simply pinch the grip  between fingers and push to fit, which keeps the tip going into the ears clean even if hands are somewhat soiled with dirt, oil, grease, or some other contaminant. The unique, slow recovery foam is easy to fit in the earcanal with no roll-down required for a comfortable, noise-blocking seal. Assorted grip colors available.    * These soft polyurethane foam earplugs have a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of 25 dB and are test compatible with the 3M E-A-Rfit Validation System.  Not only is noise present in our daily routines and recreational activities, but millions of Americans work in hazardous noise on a daily basis. Estimates from the National Institutes of Health suggest that approximately 15 percent of Americans (26 million people) between the ages of 20 and 69 have high frequency hearing loss due to exposure to noise at work or during leisure activities. Hearing loss due to noise is almost entirely preventable by judicious use of hearing protection. *  * *The NRR may overestimate the hearing protection provided during typical use. 3M recommends reducing the NRR by 50% for estimating the amount of noise reduction provided. *

                    The 3M E-A-R UltraFit Corded Earplugs feature a no-roll, triple-flange design that provides quick, clean, and comfortable hearing protection. Simply hold the stem and push the earplug into the ear. The tip stays clean even if hands are dirty or gloves are worn. The soft polymer earplugs are washable and reusable so they dont need to be replaced as often, reducing waste and lowerings costs. Poly bag keeps earplugs clean prior to use. Recommended applications include assembly and mechanical, chipping, chiseling, cleaning, drilling, furnace operations, grinding, heavy equipment operations, machining, metal repair, painting, pouring/casting, power fastening, riveting, sanding, sawing and welding. These earplugs are commonly used in the following industries: construction, general manufacturing, mining, oil and gas, and transportation.  These soft polymer earplugs have a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of 25 dB and are test compatible with the 3M E-A-Rfit Validation System.  Not only is noise present in our daily routines and recreational activities, but millions of Americans work in hazardous noise on a daily basis. Estimates from the National Institutes of Health suggest that approximately 15 percent of Americans (26 million people) between the ages of 20 and 69 have high frequency hearing loss due to exposure to noise at work or during leisure activities. Hearing loss due to noise is almost entirely preventable by judicious use of hearing protection. *  * *The NRR may overestimate the hearing protection provided during typical use. 3M recommends reducing the NRR by 50% for estimating the amount of noise reduction provided. *

                    The 3M™ Paper Sheet 426U is a premium silicon carbide sheet that helps create a smoother finish than aluminum oxide or garnet abrasive products on painted metal and wood substrates. Its resin bond construction provides superior grain retention while the open coat construction, along with the load-resistant coating, combine to provide excellent anti-loading characteristics. The light A-weight backing helps provide conformability over contours and into hard-to-reach areas. The sheet can also be easily cut to fit a hand pad block, inline sanders or finishing or power sanders. Other applications include general sanding, finishing, blending, surface leveling and prep prior to staining or painting. These versatile sanding sheets contain the ideal abrasive grain type and grades for multi-step finishing processes.
