  * Easy pad replacement Snap-in design of wear pads allows them to be replaced quickly in the field.
  * Compliant Meets ANSI Z359.18 Anchorage Connector standard; OSHA 420 lb./ANSI 310 lb. ratings.
  * Versatile size ranges to fit a variety of beams � Replaceable wear pads � 360-degree swiveling D-ring anchor point � Integrated dual ratcheting system � High-strength, lightweight steel and aluminum construction � 5,000 lb. (22 kN) strength and up to 420 lb. (189 kg) capacity
  * Applications: � Bridge work � Buildings � Warehouses � Arenas � Parking ramps
  * Complete mobility. It's critical to getting the job done, just like your safety. With the new 3M� DBI-SALA� Sliding Beam Anchor, you get the best of both worlds. Once you secure it to the beam using the redesigned adjustment buttons, simply connect your Self-Retracting Lifeline (SRL)* or lanyard to the swiveling D-ring and you're ready to work. The anchor point slides effortlessly behind you.
